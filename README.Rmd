**Disclaimer**  
The code presented here is experimental and was developed with *within-subject designs* in mind. Extensions to *between-subject designs* are planned, but no concrete timeline is currently available. Moreover, the implementation does not yet include formal tests.

Therefore, if your primary goal is to conduct inference for state-trace analysis, we presently recommend using the approach by @dunn2018. A convenient option is the package available at <https://github.com/monotonicity/stacmr>, which provides a wrapper for the methodology implemented in <https://github.com/michaelkalish/STA>.

If, however, you are specifically interested in PIRST and wish to explore or experiment with it, the material provided below may serve as a starting point.

# pirst
State-trace analysis (STA) is a novel, rigorous, and highly general method for investigating questions of dimensionality. Although STA has gained attention in recent years, statistical testing procedures for the method have only recently begun to emerge.  

A particularly promising approach is *Permuted Isotonic Regression for State-Trace* [PIRST, @benjamin2019], a nonparametric algorithm based on isotonic regression. This package implements the core PIRST algorithm in R and extends it by including a significance test based on a null model, similar in spirit to the procedure described by @dunn2018. Additionally, functions for simulation studies are provided to facilitate evaluation and exploration of this relatively new method.  

For a more detailed discussion of this implementation, see Lukas Rommel's master thesis, included in this repository. The thesis evaluates the strengths and limitations of PIRST using ROC, sensitivity, and specificity analyses, and concludes with practical recommendations for applied use.
